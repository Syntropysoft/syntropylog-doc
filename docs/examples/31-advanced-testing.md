# Advanced Testing Scenarios

> **Coming Soon** - This example will cover advanced testing scenarios including:
> 
> - Complex integration testing patterns
> - Performance testing with mocks
> - End-to-end testing strategies
> - Custom mock implementations
> - Testing with multiple services
> - Advanced context management testing

## What's Coming

This example will demonstrate how to handle complex testing scenarios that go beyond basic unit testing:

### Planned Features

- **Complex Integration Testing** - Testing multiple services working together
- **Performance Testing** - Using mocks for performance validation
- **Custom Mock Extensions** - Creating specialized mocks for your needs
- **End-to-End Testing** - Testing complete workflows with mocks
- **Advanced Context Patterns** - Testing complex context scenarios
